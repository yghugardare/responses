      userAnswer:
        "During my articleship, I had the chance to lead a small team for an internal audit project of a mid-sized company. It was my first time taking charge, and I was nervous, but I knew I had to ensure the team stayed on track. I started by dividing the tasks based on everyone’s strengths and made sure we had clear communication. One of the biggest challenges was managing tight deadlines while maintaining accuracy, but I kept motivating the team and even stayed back to review everyone’s work.\n\nFrom this experience, I learned the importance of being approachable as a leader. There were moments when team members felt stuck, and instead of just instructing, I worked alongside them to solve issues. It also taught me that proper planning and consistent follow-ups can reduce stress for everyone. Most importantly, I realized that when you respect and trust your team, they give their best, and the results can exceed expectations.",
